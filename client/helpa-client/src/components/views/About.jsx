              Britain has a horrific homelessness crisis.
              <br />
              ~300.000 homeless <small>(Shelter report, 2019)</small>,<br />
              ~11.000 on the streets{" "}
              <small>(London only, CHAIN report, 2020)</small>.
              <br />
              <br />
              But worrisome is not only the ridiculous number of people that are
              homeless...
              <br />
              <div className="blockquote">
                ...it is the fact that nearly everyone else "feel[s] powerless
                to help"
                <br />
                <small>(76%, UK, crisis, 2019)</small>.
              </div>
              Why do people donate to people living on the streets? <br />
              <div className="blockquote">
                Feeling bad for them & carrying spare change.
              </div>
              How will it work in a cashless society?
              <div className="blockquote">Not everyone can create a bank account.</div>
              However, with DLT, people living outside the system can now be
              banked outside the system. We empower the homeless with an IOTA
              address in form of a QR code.
              <br />
              <div className="blockquote">
                Few people love the homeless, many love innovation.
              </div>
              This is not an attempt to solve a social issue through
              technological innovation, it is an attempt to solve a social issue
              through excitement about new technologies.
              <br />
              <div className="blockquote">The homeless have IOTA, do you?</div>
              All we do is host a database of QRs and provide selected
              volunteers the ability to cash out for the homeless in return for
              their tokens.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can donate even without the site running and we are happy to
              share the beneficiaries' private keys with relevant platforms.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now, although micro-donations help an affected person mentally and
              get him through the day, they are not a sustainable solution to
              get somebody off the streets. That is why location tracking,
              digital identity and individual-driven campaigns will be used to
              support volunteers to solve the underlying problem.
              <br />
              <br />
              Regardless of the reason a person ends up on the streets instead
              of receiving or accepting help, who are we to leave these people
              without attention?
              <hr />
              We are a network of volunteers that help match donators
              without cash to beneficiaries with QR codes. We pursue a similar
              approach to couchsurfing.com or craigslist.org. However, as we do
              not make any revenue with this service nor directly deal with
              money a legal entity is not required.
