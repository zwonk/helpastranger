This section guides you through reporting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand the bug, reproduce the behavior, and find related bugs.

### Before reporting a bug

Please check the following list:

- **Do not open a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities**, instead, please contact us [here](mailto:info@helpastranger.net).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/zwonk/helpastranger/issues). If the bug has already been reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. You can also find related issues by their [label](https://github.com/zwonk/helpastranger/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc).

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting A Bug Report

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/zwonk/helpastranger/issues/new), and be sure to include as many details as possible, using the template.

**Note:** Minor changes such as fixing a typo can but do not need an open issue.

If you also want to fix the bug, submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) and reference the issue.
